Apache Flink is designed with strong fault-tolerance mechanisms, ensuring resilience and minimal data loss during failures. Here’s a documented explanation of how Flink handles TaskManager failure, especially in streaming jobs.

---

### 1. **Understanding TaskManager Failure**

TaskManager is a worker node in Flink that executes subtasks of a job. If a TaskManager fails during execution, especially during processing or holding intermediate results, Flink needs to detect and handle this failure efficiently.

---

### 2. **Failure Detection Mechanism**

* **Heartbeat Protocol**: Flink uses a heartbeat mechanism between JobManager (master) and TaskManagers.
* If a TaskManager stops sending heartbeats, it's marked as failed by the JobManager.

---

### 3. **Impact of Failure**

* The failed TaskManager’s subtasks stop executing.
* Any **in-flight data** (data currently being processed but not yet checkpointed) may be lost.

---

### 4. **Fault Tolerance via Checkpointing**

* **Checkpointing**: Flink periodically creates consistent snapshots (checkpoints) of the state of all operators.
* These checkpoints include the data that has been processed and the internal state of the operators (e.g., window buffers, counters).

#### Recovery Steps:

1. Detect failure via JobManager.
2. Cancel the job and restart it from the last successful checkpoint.
3. Redistribute failed tasks to healthy TaskManagers.
4. Restore the operator states from the checkpoint.

---

### 5. **Handling Duplicates**

* When recovering from a checkpoint, some events **might be reprocessed**.
* Flink provides **exactly-once** and **at-least-once** semantics based on how checkpointing and sinks are configured.
* Best practice: Ensure **idempotent sinks** (sinks that can handle duplicate records without side effects).

---

### 6. **High Availability (HA)**

* With HA setup, if either JobManager or TaskManager fails, a standby node can take over using metadata stored in a durable storage like ZooKeeper and persistent state backend (e.g., RocksDB).

| Feature           | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Failure Detection | Heartbeat between JobManager and TaskManager          |
| Data Loss         | In-flight data may be lost without checkpointing      |
| Recovery Strategy | Restart from latest checkpoint and redistribute tasks |
| Semantics         | Exactly-once or At-least-once based on config         |
| State Storage     | RocksDB, MemoryStateBackend, FsStateBackend           |

---

### Notes

* Proper tuning of checkpoint intervals, timeout, and state backend is essential for resilient streaming jobs.
* For better durability and performance, use RocksDB with incremental checkpoints for large states.
