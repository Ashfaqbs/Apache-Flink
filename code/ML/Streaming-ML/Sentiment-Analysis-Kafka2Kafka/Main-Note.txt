- sentiment analysis Flow:

load data from Excel -> Encodes labels using LabelEncoder -> Created a Pipeline with TfidfVectorizer + LogisticRegression ->
Trains and dumps the model and label encoder

expose an api 




- pros

- decoupled, more maintainable, and target scaling (pods -> HPA), creative ml lib compared to flink ml.

- cons
Latency 

maybe smaller payloads , resource-rich  servers and proximity of the servers (flink - ml API servers ) should be more so travelling distance is less so less network  IO



- Kafka
