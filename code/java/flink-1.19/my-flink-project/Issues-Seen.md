### **1. Why do we need both Serialization and Deserialization configurations?**
Serialization and deserialization are two sides of the same coin in data exchange. Here's why we need both:

- **Deserialization (Python Producer â†’ Java Consumer)**
    - our  **Python producer** sends data (probably JSON or Avro format).
    - our  **Java consumer** receives this data and needs to convert (deserialize) it into a `MyEvent` object.
    - If the JSON contains an `Instant` field (`"timestamp": "2024-04-03T12:00:00Z"`), Java needs to **map it correctly** to `java.time.Instant`.
    - `JavaTimeModule` helps the deserializer understand this format.

- **Serialization (Java â†’ Kafka or other systems)**
    - If our  Java application **processes and then forwards** the event to another system (e.g., Flink, Kafka, another service), it needs to **convert the object back to bytes (serialize it)**.
    - Kafka, Flink, or any other messaging system **doesnâ€™t understand Java objects**â€”they only work with raw byte arrays (JSON, Avro, Protobuf, etc.).
    - If our  event contains `Instant`, **the serializer also needs to handle it correctly**, so the next system (or language) can parse it.

#### ðŸ”¥ **Key Rule: If our  Java app both consumes (deserializes) and produces (serializes) events, both must support the same format.**
If deserialization works but serialization fails, the problem is that the Java serializer doesn't understand how to handle `Instant`.

### **2. Why mention Java 8 when weâ€™re using Java 11?**
We're using Java 11, **but the issue isn't about the Java version**â€”it's about the **default behavior of Jacksonâ€™s ObjectMapper**.

- **Java 8 introduced `java.time` API**, including `Instant`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, etc.
- **Java 11 continues to use these APIs**, but **ObjectMapper by default doesnâ€™t support them**, even in Java 11.
- That's why we must explicitly **register the JavaTimeModule**, regardless of Java 8, 11, or 17.

ðŸ‘‰ The problem isnâ€™t our  Java version but **Jackson's default handling of Java 8+ date types.** Even in Java 17 or 21, we still need `JavaTimeModule`.

---

### **Example to Clarify**

#### **Without `JavaTimeModule` (Serialization Fails)**
```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Instant now = Instant.now();
        System.out.println(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(now));  // ERROR! Jackson doesn't know how to handle Instant
    }
}
```
**Error:**
```
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: 
No serializer found for class java.time.Instant
```

#### **With `JavaTimeModule` (Serialization Works)**
```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule;
import java.time.Instant;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());  // Register JavaTimeModule
        Instant now = Instant.now();
        System.out.println(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(now));  // Works!
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```json
"2024-04-03T12:30:45.123Z"
```

Now, Jackson correctly serializes `Instant` to an ISO-8601 string (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`).

---

### **Final Takeaways**
âœ… **Deserialization config (Java Consumer) is needed** because our  Python producer sends `Instant`, and Java must convert it properly.  
âœ… **Serialization config (Java Producer) is needed** if our  Java app sends events to another system and must correctly serialize `Instant`.  
âœ… **Java 8+ uses `java.time`, but Jackson doesnâ€™t support it by default**â€”so even in Java 11, we must register `JavaTimeModule`.
