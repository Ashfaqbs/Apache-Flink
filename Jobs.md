## **Flink Jobs: Execution, Submission, and Inter-Job Communication**

### **A. What Is a Flink Job?**

A **Flink job** is our application code written using the Flink API (in Java, Scala, or Python). It defines the processing logic for data streams‚Äîthis can include transformations (like filter, map, reduce), aggregations, or more complex event processing. The job is packaged into an artifact (such as a JAR for Java/Scala or a script/package for Python) and submitted to a running Flink cluster.

### **B. Inter-Job Communication**

While Flink jobs are generally independent, one job can produce data that another job consumes through external systems. For example:
- **Connector-based Communication:**  
  - **Job A** writes its output to a Kafka topic, a file system, or a database.
  - **Job B** reads from that same source.
  
This decouples the jobs, allowing them to interact indirectly. Direct communication (i.e., one job invoking another) isn‚Äôt typical; instead, data flows through shared external systems.

### **C. Ways to Submit a Flink Job**

There are several methods to submit a Flink job, depending on how we deploy our Flink cluster.

#### **1. Submitting via Docker (Using Flink‚Äôs Web UI)**

1. **Start our Flink Cluster in Docker:**  
   - Use the official Flink Docker image to run a cluster. This typically exposes the Flink Dashboard on port 8081.
   
2. **Access the Flink Web UI:**  
   - Open our browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081` (or the appropriate host/port).

3. **Upload our Job Artifact:**  
   - Click on the ‚ÄúSubmit new Job‚Äù button.
   - Upload our JAR file (or specify our Python script for PyFlink).
   - Configure job parameters, such as parallelism or runtime arguments if needed.

4. **Submit the Job:**  
   - Once submitted, the job starts running.  
     - **Streaming Job:** Continues to run until explicitly canceled.
     - **Batch Job:** Automatically finishes after processing the finite dataset.

#### **2. Submitting via Standalone Binary (Command Line Interface)**

1. **Download & Unpack Flink:**  
   - Get the Flink binary distribution from the [official website](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) and extract it.

2. **Start the Flink Cluster:**  
   - Navigate to the Flink directory and run:
     ```bash
     ./bin/start-cluster.sh
     ```
   - This starts a local cluster with a JobManager and one or more TaskManagers.

3. **Submit our Job Using the CLI:**  
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     ./bin/flink run path/to/our-job.jar
     ```
   - Pass any necessary parameters. Flink will schedule the job on the cluster and start processing.

4. **Monitor the Job:**  
   - we can monitor the job‚Äôs progress through the Flink Web UI at `http://localhost:8081`.

### **D. Additional Important Points**

- **Artifact Creation:**  
  - For Java/Scala jobs, compile and package our code into a JAR file.
  - For Python jobs, ensure our script or package is ready for submission.

- **Job Lifecycle:**  
  - A **streaming job** runs indefinitely (until we cancel it) since it processes unbounded data.
  - A **batch job** stops automatically once the dataset is fully processed.

- **Environment Integration:**  
  - Ensure that our Flink runtime (whether running on Docker, as a standalone binary, or on a cluster) is properly configured and accessible to receive and run our submitted job.

This section serves as a practical guide for deploying Flink jobs, how they communicate, and the steps we need to follow to run our code on a Flink cluster.

### **Who Do We Give the artifact To and Where Do We Place It?**  

The JAR file for a Flink job needs to be **submitted to the Flink JobManager**, which is responsible for scheduling and running the job across TaskManagers. The **path where you place the JAR depends on how Flink is deployed**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs running in **Docker (containerized)** or as a **standalone binary installation**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ If Flink is Running in Docker (Containerized Setup)**
### **Where to Place the JAR?**
Since Flink is running inside a container, you need to **copy the JAR into the JobManager container** and then submit it.

### **‚úÖ Steps to Submit the JAR in Docker:**
1. **Copy the JAR into the Flink JobManager container**  
   ```bash
   docker cp target/your-flink-job.jar docker-jobmanager-1:/tmp/your-flink-job.jar
   ```
   - This places the JAR inside the container at `/tmp/your-flink-job.jar`.

2. **Submit the JAR inside the container**  
   ```bash
   docker exec -it docker-jobmanager-1 /opt/flink/bin/flink run /tmp/your-flink-job.jar
   ```
   - This runs the job inside the Flink cluster.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ If Flink is Running as a Binary Installation (Standalone Mode)**
### **Where to Place the JAR?**
In a **binary installation**, Flink is installed on a local server or a cluster. You can submit the JAR from anywhere, but the default location for Flink jobs is **`$FLINK_HOME/lib/`**.

### **‚úÖ Steps to Submit the JAR in Standalone Mode:**
1. **Place the JAR inside Flink's `lib/` directory** (or any accessible path):  
   ```bash
   cp target/your-flink-job.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
   ```
   *(Replace `$FLINK_HOME` with the actual Flink installation path.)*

2. **Submit the JAR using Flink's CLI:**
   ```bash
   $FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run $FLINK_HOME/lib/your-flink-job.jar
   ```
   - This submits the job to the Flink JobManager running on your server.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ If Flink is Running in a Cluster (Remote JobManager)**
### **Where to Place the JAR?**
If you are submitting a job to a **remote Flink cluster**, you don‚Äôt need to manually copy the JAR. You can **directly submit the job from your local machine** to the JobManager.

### **‚úÖ Steps to Submit the JAR to a Remote Cluster**
1. **Submit the job from your local machine**:
   ```bash
   flink run -m <jobmanager-host>:8081 -c your.main.ClassName /path/to/your-flink-job.jar
   ```
   - Replace `<jobmanager-host>` with the **JobManager's IP or hostname**.
   - Replace `your.main.ClassName` with the **fully qualified name** of your main class.

## **üìå Summary:**
| Deployment Type | Where to Place the JAR? | How to Submit? |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Docker (Containerized Flink)** | Copy JAR to `/tmp/` inside JobManager | `docker exec -it docker-jobmanager-1 /opt/flink/bin/flink run /tmp/your-flink-job.jar` |
| **Standalone Binary (Local Machine or Server)** | Place JAR in `$FLINK_HOME/lib/` | `$FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run $FLINK_HOME/lib/your-flink-job.jar` |
| **Remote Flink Cluster** | No need to manually place JAR | `flink run -m <jobmanager-host>:8081 -c your.main.ClassName /path/to/your-flink-job.jar` |

So, depending on how you're running Flink, you either **copy the JAR to the JobManager (Docker setup)** or **submit it directly via Flink CLI (Standalone or Remote Cluster)**.
